# My Awesome Project
This is a complex API that renders all the weather of all NASA stations.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
The button is set to fetch the weather of a NASA station and creates a table node on the DOM to display weather.

## Optimizations

Would like to optimize the application to fetch all weathers for all NASA stations and render them on the DOM.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned to make a complex API fetching from one API and using the longitude and latitude of the NASA station API to fetch the weather and then render the data on to the DOM.
